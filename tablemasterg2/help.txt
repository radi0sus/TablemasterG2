# Tablemaster2G

`Tablemaster2G` generates (nice) "experimental data" tables from SHELXL generated CIFs (Crystallographic Information File).
The program is written in PureBasic.

## Use is simple:

1. Open up to 5 CIFs with the `Load CIF n` buttons.

2. Decide if you want to include `Temperature` and `Moiety Formula`.

3. Decide if you want units in `[unit]` or more SI-like style `/unit` style by checking `SI Units`.

4. A plain text overview is displayed in the preview window. RTF, LaTeX and Markdown outputs will look differently from plain text but contain essentially the same information. 

5. Adapt the page orientation to your needs. The `Auto` feature changes the orientation to `Landscape` if the table exceeds 4 columns.

6. Copy the resulting table as RTF (useful for MS Word or Libre Office Writer), LaTeX, plain (Unicode) text, plain text with Markdown formatting with the `Copy Format` buttons.

7. It is also possible to save the resulting table in one of the above formats by clicking the appropriate `Save Format` button.


## Other options

* `Clear all`: Clears everything.
* `Help`	 : Displays this help.
* `About`	 : Version and license.
* `Exit`	 : Exit.


## Limitations

* `Tablemaster2G` can handle SHELXL generated CIFs only (starting from SHELXL-97).

* The CIF should be free of errors, otherwise outputs will be senseless or the program will crash.

* If the space group is not given in the way `Tablemaster2G` can handle it, the space group will be replaced by `?`. Recent SHELXL versions insert the space group automatically. The format is recognized by the program. 

* Tables can exceed the size of a A4 page in the LaTeX output. In this case you have to reduce the number of columns, change the page orientation or use the `tabularx` environment (has to be inserted manually in the `.tex` file). 

* The number of recognized CIF items is fixed in the source code.

## Compilation

* `Tablemaster2G.pb`, `help.txt`, `license.txt` should be in the same folder. 

* Open `Tablemaster2G.pb` with PureBasic. 

* Choose `Create Executable...` in the `Compiler` menu.

* Tested with PureBasic 5.50, Windows 10 (x64) and Linux (x64).
